Developing an extension that can read your screen and give you live data updates and tips on your favourite baseball games! (With permission)

## The workflow

## The looks

This is the side panel. You can open this in any youtube video (currently works only for youtube).

This is the options page. This page is to help you predict your MLB future and a how to guide on the **technical implementations** of the extension. It involves the entire pipeline!

## Work

- [ ] Add comments to code (makes it easier to create the guide as well)
- [ ] Create the workflow in Canva (ongoing)
- [ ] Write all the prompts
- [ ] Figure out the sending and processing of buffer

Have created seperate ports for the panel and the options page because it will be much easier to manage and make changes in that.

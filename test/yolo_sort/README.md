# Training and testing YOLOv5

1. Create a Manual dataset (painful)
2. Create a Roboflow dataset (not as painful)

- [ ] Collect a bunch of baseball images (in the wild, so during the game itself not static images)
- [ ] Create labels manually
- [ ] Prepare it for YOLOv5 by exporting it in the right format
- [ ] Select a model (we'll go with YOLOv5s)

Man this is painful. Study more on how to do this.

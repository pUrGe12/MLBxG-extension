# Testing YOLOv5

1. Create a Manual dataset (painful)

ðŸš€ Create a Roboflow dataset (not as painful) 

- [x] Test bounding box for a static image in the wild 
- [x] Test boudning box for a video

The problem here is that, I need to keep the threshold confidence very low for detections to happen (like 12%ish). Even then, the model doesn't detect baseballs sometimes.

**The likely issue is that, the images we've used to train are more focused on the baseball, rather than happening in a real game. Find better images and train it again**

- [ ] Create a new dataset and train the model again

## New Idea

- [x] What we can do is, before detection, tweak each frame of the video to match the training and testing dataset. That will definetly increase the confidence rate.

**Not working**

# Training

These are the steps you need to follow to train your YOLOv5s model.

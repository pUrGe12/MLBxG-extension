# Testing YOLOv5

1. Create a Manual dataset (painful)

ðŸš€ Create a Roboflow dataset (not as painful) 

- [x] Test bounding box for a static image in the wild 
- [x] Test boudning box for a video

The problem here is that, I need to keep the threshold confidence very low for detections to happen (like 12%ish). Even then, the model doesn't detect baseballs sometimes.

**The likely issue is that, the images we've used to train are more focused on the baseball, rather than happening in a real game. Find better images and train it again**

- [ ] Create a new dataset and train the model again

## New Idea

- [x] What we can do is, before detection, tweak each frame of the video to match the training and testing dataset. That will definetly increase the confidence rate.

**Not working**

# Training

These are the steps you need to follow to train your YOLOv5s model.


Clone the YOLOv5 repository

		git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
		cd yolov5

Install the dependencies

		pip install -r requirements.txt

Head over to a [roboflow dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/yolotest1/yolov5test2). Download the dataset in the `YOLO v5 PyTorch` format. You might get a download link as below. 

Execute the script where you want to save your dataset. Mostly do this inside the `yolov5` directory itself (that we cloned above)

		curl -L "https://universe.roboflow.com/ds/lPAYhwr8hN?key=o2ef7xqXid" > roboflow.zip; unzip roboflow.zip; rm roboflow.zip

Ensure that it has a `train` and `test` directories with **images** and **labels** inside them.

Then edit the `data.yaml` file and update the paths to the training and testing datasets

> [!NOTE]
> You can remove the `val` header in there. Also, if the dataset contains more than 1 objects that it can detect, then insure that you're filtering for baseballs only.

Example `data.yaml`

		train: ../train/images
		val: ../valid/images
		test: ../test/images

		nc: 3
		names: ['ball', 'bat', 'glove']

Now, comes the crucial part. Read the `README.roboflow.txt` it will look something like this

		Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
		* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
		* collect & organize images
		* understand and search unstructured image data
		* annotate, and create datasets
		* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
		* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

		For state of the art Computer Vision training notebooks you can use with this dataset,
		visit https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks

		To find over 100k other datasets and pre-trained models, visit https://universe.roboflow.com

		The dataset includes 895 images.
		Baseball are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

		The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
		* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
		* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

		The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
		* 50% probability of horizontal flip
		* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise

This is important because 

1. We want to enter the image size when we are training it (in this case 640x640 pixels). 
2. We want to create the exact same situation when we are testing it in our use case (that is, before running this model, we'll edit the image similarly and resize it)

---

Inside the `yolov5` directory then run the following code

		python3 train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data ./data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --name baseball_detection

This will start training the model. The new weights will be saved in `runs/train/baseball_detection/weights/best.pt`

So, in order to use the model, we'll have to use the `best.pt` weights. Refer to the using codes for that. 


# Testing

Use the python codes present [here](./MoreTestingYoLoAndTracking/flow.py) to test if the model is a good fit or not.

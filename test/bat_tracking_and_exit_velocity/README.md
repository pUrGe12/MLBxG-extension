So, the figures indicate that the speed vs time graph is exponentially high when it reaches the end of the video (probably due to the abrupt ending or something)

1. Figure out a way to get the maximum that is not the skewed one!
2. Test if this is happening for all the videos

3. We can't detect bats that are black! FUCKED~
